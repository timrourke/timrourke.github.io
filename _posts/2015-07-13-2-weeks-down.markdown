It's past midnight on Sunday and I am tired but happy to have been working all day. Perhaps next week I will not neglect my authorly duties, but in the mean time, here is an appropriate quote for today:

<blockquote>
<p>"If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people together to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."</p><br>

<cite>— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</cite>
</blockquote>

Oh, how I long for those waves.
