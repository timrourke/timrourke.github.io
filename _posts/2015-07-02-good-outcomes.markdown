Much has been said about the promises of employment made by programming bootcamps over the past few years. A quick Google search for "programming bootcamp" turns up countless hits of posts and articles both critical and laudatory of the employment prospects of a bootcamp student. As a new student participating in this relatively untested educational model, I was naturally quite skeptical of strong claims about students beginning their careers with significant salaries and a bright future.

Fast forward to yesterday evening, and a chat with several students from the last cohort reveals more than a glimmer of hope. For a cohort of less than 20 students, more than 150 people responsible for hiring at Chicago tech firms were in attendance, meeting students and making offers. Several students came away with job offers after mere hours of conversation.

Hearing these kinds of experiences firsthand is far more powerful than the anecdotes I've read on the web. Sounds like I made a good choice of getting in on the gold rush.
