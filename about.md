Hello, world. I'm [Tim Rourke](http://timrourke.com).

On June 29th, 2015, I embarked on a new adventure. I've joined the 2nd-ever Chicago cohort of [General Assembly's](http://generalassemb.ly) Web Development Intensive program.

This simple blog serves to document my educational experience wading headfirst into this new-fangled world of intensive vocational training and the quicksand that is web development. I hope to share my successes, failures, and insights with those on a similar path.
