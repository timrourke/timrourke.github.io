# Hello, world. I'm [Tim Rourke](http://timrourke.com).

On June 29th, 2015, I embarked on a new adventure. I've joined the 2nd-ever Chicago cohort of [General Assembly's](http://generalassemb.ly) Web Development Intensive program.

This simple blog serves to document my educational experience wading headfirst into this new-fangled world of intensive vocational training and the quicksand that is web development. I hope to share my successes, failures, and insights with those on a similar path.

## My other site

For other info about me, my professional portfolio, and yet more bloggy goodness, check out my primary site at [timrourke.com](http://timrourke.com).

## About this site

As you can probably guess by the URL, this blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Like many using this excellent, *free* hosting service, I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as my static site generator (I refuse to call it a CMS). The color scheme is Ethan Schoonover's gorgeous [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color pallette developed for use in code editors. The typeface is Adobe's lovely [Source Code Pro](http://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/), an open source font designed for programming.
